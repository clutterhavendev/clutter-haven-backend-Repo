# Data Engineering Pipeline Implementation Steps
## From Source to Analytics-Ready Data Warehouse

### Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step process to build a data warehouse pipeline for the Clutter Haven backend, serving both Data Analysts and Machine Learning teams.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup

### Step 1: Environment Setup
- Set up development environment with Python 3.8+
- Install required packages (SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Apache Airflow/Prefect, pandas, etc.)
- Configure Git branch for data engineering work
- Set up separate virtual environment to avoid conflicts

### Step 2: Project Structure Creation
- Create `data_engineering/` directory in the repo
- Set up subdirectories for ETL, warehouse, configs, and documentation
- Initialize Python packages with `__init__.py` files
- Create README.md for the data engineering module

### Step 3: Configuration Management
- Create separate configuration files for DE work
- Set up environment variables for:
  - Source database connection (read-only)
  - Warehouse database connection
  - ETL job configurations
  - Logging paths
- Implement configuration validation

---

## Phase 2: Data Source Analysis

### Step 4: Source System Discovery
- Connect to the existing application database (read-only)
- Document all tables and their relationships
- Identify data types and constraints
- Map out foreign key relationships
- Calculate data volumes for capacity planning

### Step 5: Data Profiling
- Analyze data quality in source tables
- Identify missing values, duplicates, and anomalies
- Document business rules and data patterns
- Create data dictionaries for each table
- Identify slowly changing dimensions (SCDs)

### Step 6: Requirements Gathering
- Interview stakeholders (DA and ML teams)
- Document specific metrics and KPIs needed
- Identify refresh frequency requirements
- Define data retention policies
- List required transformations and aggregations

---

## Phase 3: Warehouse Design

### Step 7: Warehouse Infrastructure Setup
- Provision warehouse database (PostgreSQL/Snowflake/BigQuery)
- Set up database schemas:
  - `raw` - Exact copies from source
  - `staging` - Cleaned and standardized
  - `analytics` - For DA team
  - `ml` - For ML team
- Configure user access and permissions

### Step 8: Data Model Design
- Design fact and dimension tables for analytics
- Create feature store schema for ML
- Define primary keys and indexes
- Plan partitioning strategy (by date, vendor, etc.)
- Document naming conventions

### Step 9: Create Warehouse Tables
- Write DDL scripts for all warehouse tables
- Implement table creation with proper data types
- Set up constraints and indexes
- Create views for common queries
- Version control all DDL scripts

---

## Phase 4: ETL Pipeline Development

### Step 10: Build Data Extraction Layer
- Create database connection managers
- Implement incremental extraction logic
- Add error handling and retry mechanisms
- Set up extraction logging
- Build data validation on extract

### Step 11: Develop Transformation Logic
- Implement data cleaning functions
- Create business logic transformations
- Build aggregation procedures
- Develop feature engineering for ML
- Add data quality checks

### Step 12: Create Loading Procedures
- Implement bulk loading for initial loads
- Build incremental/merge loading logic
- Add pre and post-load validations
- Set up load logging and monitoring
- Implement rollback procedures

---

## Phase 5: Orchestration & Automation

### Step 13: Pipeline Orchestration
- Choose orchestration tool (Airflow/Prefect/Dagster)
- Create DAGs for each pipeline
- Set up dependencies between jobs
- Configure scheduling (daily, hourly, etc.)
- Implement failure notifications

### Step 14: Monitoring & Alerting
- Set up pipeline monitoring dashboards
- Configure data quality alerts
- Implement SLA monitoring
- Create data freshness checks
- Build reconciliation reports

### Step 15: Testing & Validation
- Unit test transformation functions
- Integration test full pipelines
- Validate data accuracy (source vs warehouse)
- Performance test with production volumes
- User acceptance testing with DA/ML teams

---

## Phase 6: Optimization & Documentation

### Step 16: Performance Optimization
- Analyze query patterns from users
- Optimize slow-running transformations
- Add appropriate indexes
- Implement table partitioning
- Consider materialized views for common queries

### Step 17: Documentation & Training
- Create comprehensive documentation:
  - Table definitions and relationships
  - ETL job descriptions
  - Query examples for analysts
  - Feature definitions for ML
- Conduct training sessions for end users
- Create runbooks for operations

### Step 18: Security & Compliance
- Implement data masking for PII
- Set up audit logging
- Configure backup and recovery
- Document data retention policies
- Ensure GDPR/compliance requirements

---

## Phase 7: Go-Live & Maintenance

### Step 19: Production Deployment
- Deploy to production environment
- Run initial historical data loads
- Validate production data quality
- Enable scheduled jobs
- Monitor initial runs closely

### Step 20: Continuous Improvement
- Gather user feedback
- Monitor pipeline performance
- Optimize based on usage patterns
- Add new data sources as needed
- Plan for scaling

---
